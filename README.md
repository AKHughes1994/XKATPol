# XKAT Polarization Repository
Repository of tools and scripts for snapshot (i.e., short track) imaging with MeerKAT. Mainly as a part of the X-KAT collaboration. 

Right now we have the directories: 

1. "Polkat" --- This is a modified version of oxkat (https://github.com/IanHeywood/oxkat) that includes full polarization calibration.
2. "PointSourceRMSynth" --- This is a modified version of the CIRADA's RMtools_1D package https://github.com/CIRADA-Tools/RM-Tools), and is a guide for performing rotation measure synthesis.

More details will be included within each directory
